AACF is not a church and should not substitute for your regular church attendance. However, we can arrange for rides to the following churches to help you get plugged into the area! Shoot an email to a church rides coordinator or use this [form](https://tinyurl.com/aacf2019rides) to sign up for rides!

## [Lighthouse Community Church](https://lighthousesouthbay.org/){: target="_blank"} (Torrance, CA)
Contact [Kimberly Hom or Timothy Li](mailto:kimberlyh.hoops31@gmail.com,timothyli97@gmail.com?subject=AACF:%20Lighthouse%20Ride%20Request)

Come check out Lighthouse's college ministry Beacon, which is held every Friday starting at 7:30 pm! If you have committed to attending Lighthouse Church, we highly encourage you to consider becoming a member, especially before serving. If you are unable to attend the membership series this quarter, you can still serve in Children's Ministry---ask a member for more info.

You are welcome to check out our Friday night ministries AWANA (children's ministry) and Mustard Seed (middle school ministry). You can also serve as a student leader for Sojourners (college ministry). Church membership is also encouraged as you decide on committing to a ministry, but you are welcome to check out ministries as long as you need. Feel free to ask the rides coordinators or anyone currently serving for more info.

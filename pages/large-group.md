Large group is held on Wednesday nights, where everyone gathers for a time of musical worship, a wonderful skit from Salt 'N Light, a message from God's Word, and a time of prayer. This is a time where AACF as a whole can come together for fellowship and encouragement from one another in the middle of the week. Our focus is to worship God and to come to a more biblical understanding of who He is.

## Fall 2017

Week 0 Large Group (Wednesday, 9/27) will be in Kerckhoff Grand Salon @ 7:00 pm. Also come join us from dinner at De Neve dining hall at 5:15 pm. You can meet us in De Neve Plaza for both of these events! We'll be holding AACF signs.

All our past sermons are [online](/sermons).

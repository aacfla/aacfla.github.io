Large group is a time every Wednesday night where everyone in the fellowship can gather for a time of musical worship, a wonderful skit from Salt 'N Light, a message from God's Word, and a time of prayer. This is a time where AACF as a whole can come together for fellowship and encouragement from one another in the middle of the week. Our focus is to worship God and to come to a more biblical understanding of who He is.

## Fall 2017 (TODO)

Large group is at 7:30pm in CS 24. If you'd like to walk down together, meet us in De Neve Plaza at 7:00pm. Also, join us for dorm dinner at 6:00pm (meet in De Neve Plaza)!

All our past sermons are [online](/sermons).

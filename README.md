This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. It is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/customizing-github-pages/), which automatically builds Jekyll websites and serves them.

First re-install ruby:
      brew install ruby

To host/test the website locally, roughly follow <https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/>, except:
* Step 1: Instead of creating a new local repository, clone this one
* Step 2: Don't need to modify Gemfile, just run `bundle install`
* Step 3: Skip
